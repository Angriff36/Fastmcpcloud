# 🧑‍🍳 Prep Chef - Independent Package Development

## Quick Start - Any Package

```bash
# Make the script executable and run
chmod +x dev-packages.sh
./dev-packages.sh
```

## Individual Package Development

### 🎨 UI Components (Visual Design)
```bash
cd packages/ui-components && npm run design-system
# Opens: http://localhost:3002/standalone-preview.html
```

### 🔐 Authentication (Login Flows)
```bash
cd packages/auth && npm run demo
# Opens: http://localhost:3003/standalone-preview.html
```

### 📱 OCR Features (Document Scanning)
```bash
cd packages/features-ocr && npm run demo
# Opens: http://localhost:3004/standalone-preview.html
```

### 📋 Prep Lists (Task Management)
```bash
cd packages/features-prep-lists && npm run demo
# Opens: http://localhost:3005/standalone-preview.html
```

### ⚙️ Settings (Configuration)
```bash
cd packages/features-settings && npm run demo
# Opens: http://localhost:3006/standalone-preview.html
```

## What You Can Now Do

### ✅ True Independent Development
- **Design each feature separately** without needing the full app
- **No database required** for UI development
- **No authentication needed** to see components
- **Fast iteration** on visual design and interactions
- **Share demos** with team members easily

### ✅ Bolt-Style Workflow
1. **Design Phase**: Use any design tool (Bolt, Figma, etc.) to create UI
2. **Preview Phase**: Test in standalone environment
3. **Integration Phase**: Import into main app
4. **Backend Integration**: Connect to real data and services

### ✅ Development Benefits
- **Faster feedback loops** - see changes immediately
- **Isolated testing** - test components without side effects  
- **Team collaboration** - designers and developers can work in parallel
- **Progressive enhancement** - build UI first, add functionality later

## Architecture Overview

```
Independent Package Development (Design Time)
├── packages/ui-components/dev/     ← Visual design system
├── packages/auth/dev/              ← Authentication flows
├── packages/features-ocr/dev/      ← OCR scanning UI
├── packages/features-prep-lists/dev/ ← Task management UI
└── packages/features-settings/dev/ ← Settings configuration

↓ Integration (Runtime)

Full Application
└── src/App.tsx ← Imports and combines all packages
```

This gives you the **true modularity** you wanted - design your entire app piece by piece, completely independently!
