`` New in version:Â `2.0.0` `` Roots are a way for clients to inform servers about the resources they have access to. Servers can use this information to adjust behavior or provide more relevant responses.

## Setting Static Roots

Provide a list of roots when creating the client:

```
from fastmcp import Client

client = Client(

    "my_mcp_server.py", 

    roots=["/path/to/root1", "/path/to/root2"]

)
```
